        caption: "Facts About The Moon The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. The Moon's presence helps stabilize our planet's wobble and moderate our climate. The Moon's distance from Earth is about 240,000 miles (385,000km). The Moon has a very thin atmosphere called an exosphere.",
